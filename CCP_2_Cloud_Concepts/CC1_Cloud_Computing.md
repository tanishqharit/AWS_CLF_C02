# What is Cloud Computing?

## Definition

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### On-Premise

- You own the servers.
- You hire the IT people.
- You pay or rent the real estate.
- You take all the risk.

### Cloud Providers

- Someone else own the servers.
- Someone else hires the IT people.
- Someone else pays or rents the real estate.
- You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else take cares of the rest.
