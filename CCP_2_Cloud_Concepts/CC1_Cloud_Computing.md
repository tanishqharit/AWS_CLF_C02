# What is Cloud Computing?

## Definition

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### On-Premise

- You own the servers.
- You hire the IT people.
- You pay or rent the real estate.
- You take all the risk.

### Cloud Providers

- Someone else own the servers.
- Someone else hires the IT people.
- Someone else pays or rents the real estate.
- You are responsible for your configuring cloud services and code, someone else take cares of the rest.

## Types of Cloud Computing

- **Saas (Software as a Service)** : A product that is run and managed by service provider. Customers don't have to worry about how service is maintained. It just works and remains available. Example: GMail, Office 365 etc.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** : Focus on deployment and management of your apps. Customers don't have to worry about, provisioning, configuring or understanding hardware of the OS. Example: Heroku
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** : Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. Don't worry about IT staff, data centres and hardware. Example: AWS, MS Azure, GCP etc.

## Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud** : Everything (workload or project) is built on CSP. Also known as Native Cloud or Cloud First.
- **Private Cloud** : Everything built on company's data-centres. Also known as On-premise.
- **Hybrid Cloud** : Using both on premise and cloud service provider.
- **Cross Cloud** : Using multiple cloud providers. Also know as multi-cloud.

## Deployment Model Use Cases

- **Public Cloud** : Companies that are starting out today, or are small enough to make the leap enough to make the leap from a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to a CSP (Cloud Service Provider).
  - Startups, SaaS offerings, new projects and companies - Squarespace, Dropbox etc.
- **Hybrid Cloud** : Organizations that started with their own data center, can't fully move to cloud due to effort of migration or security compliance.
  - Banks, FinTech, Investment Management - Deloitte, Bank of America etc.
- **On Premise** : Organizations that cannot run on cloud due to strict regulatory compliance or the sheer size of their organization.
  - Public Sector Companies, Government, Hospitals etc.
